# I'm Artur. Welcome to my GH 🙋‍♂️

## Introduction
Born in Bytom, but currently living in Katowice. 
I've started my programming journey back at school with Pascal and C# basics. 
I was studying IT for 2 years, I've tried some more languages there - C++ (mostly), Java, Asembler. Unfortunately I had to take a break from studies, because of personal reasons. 
I've started learning HTML and CSS while I was studying IT, which was around 2 years ago. Right now I'm focusing on Javascript.
On my profile You can find a bunch of projects, some of them are made from scratch by myself and some are practise projects from Frondend Mentor. 

## My projects
### Watchmakers
My first project, basicly a watchmaker website with few sub pages. Contact form is not working, it just a visual thing for now.
