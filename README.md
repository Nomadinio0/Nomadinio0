# I'm Artur. Welcome to my GH üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Introduction
Born in Bytom, based in Katowice. 
I've started my programming journey back at tech school with Pascal and C# basics. 
I'm an IT student, currently on 6th semester. My goal is to become Fullstack Developer, but right now I'm focused on Frontend.
On my profile You can find a bunch of projects, some of them are made from scratch by myself and some are practise projects from Frondend Mentor. 

## My projects
### Watchmakers
My first project, basicly a watchmaker website with few sub pages. Contact form is not working, it's just a visual thing.
